# Yandex Translator workflow for Alfred

Yet another Ya.Translator (aka Yandex.Translator) will help you to quickly translate to/from your native/desired language. Input language detection is automatic.

Workflow can be set up to use any language pair (e.g. Italian/French). English/Russian is set by default.

You can either translate a single word, e.g. "desire", or a sentence, e.g. "isn't it a great day?".

You can either trigger workflow by `t` and query (e.g. `t hello, world`) or use a shortcut to translate selection (see below).

Example:

translates into the following and gets copied into clipboard
